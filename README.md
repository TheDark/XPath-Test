# Very simple XPath tester

This is a really simple Windows application for testing xpaths. Don't expect much, it just works for what I needed it. Maybe more features will be added in the future if I feel the need for them. No requests, though. Sorry.

## Installation

There is no installation, only an executable inside a zip. Extract it and run it.

## Usage

Populate the `XPath` and `XML Input` fields, then hit the `Run` button. If all goes well, the resulting nodes are shown in the `Result` textbox, If not, an error popup is shown. Empty textbox means there were no results.

## License

No explicit license. Use as you please, no guarantees on anything, if it doesn't work for you or your computer explodes, I'm not to blame. I don't see a reason for anything like that to happen, but still, it's your responsibility.
